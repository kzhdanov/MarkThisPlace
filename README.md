# Blank Intel XDK App Designer Project for Cordova

See [LICENSE.md][] for license terms and conditions.

Use this project as a starting point for an Intel XDK App Designer project
for creating an Apache Cordova hybrid mobile app. One key file (`init-dev.js`) 
contains the initialization code needed to handle an XDK device ready, a 
Cordova device ready or browser document ready init events in a way that 
allows you to run your app in any of these environments.

See the *Blank XDK for Cordova Project* template for more information.
